The aim of the project is to create a spatial map of market prices of apartments in Seoul, South Korea to review what I learned from online courses of data science with Python/SQL. Real estate transection histories in 2019 is acquired from the official website of Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, South Korea (http://rtdown.molit.go.kr/), and modified with simple SQL queries in IBM DB2 to derive average prices of each address.


**Convert address to sub-region and xy coordinates using Kakao-local API**

~~~
url="https://dapi.kakao.com/v2/local/search/address"
header={'authorization':'API-Key'}
df_perm=pd.DataFrame({"region":[],"x":[], "y":[]}) #create empty coordinates dataframe
for i in range(0, 6107): #6107 rows
    address={"query":seoul_apt["ADD_KOR"][i]}
    r=requests.get(url, headers=header, params=address)
    full_address=json.loads(r.text)
    try:
        region_temp=full_address['documents'][0]['address']['region_3depth_name']
        x_temp=full_address['documents'][0]['address']['x']
        y_temp=full_address['documents'][0]['address']['y']
        df_perm=df_perm.append(pd.DataFrame({"region":[region_temp], "x":[x_temp], "y":[y_temp]}))
    except (IndexError): #errors occur due to null keys in API address DB
        df_perm=df_perm.append(pd.DataFrame({"region":[null], "x":[null], "y":[null]}))
        continue

Kakao provides local API that converts address to coordinates based on WGS-1984. Since the DB of API has its limitation due to the transition to the new address system in South Korea, 27 rows are recieved as null values.

**Visualization of prices according to coordinates**

CARTOframes library is used to visualize the distribution of real estate prices.
